# SpiritSearch

## Introduction

SpiritSearch is a web application designed to help users discover new cocktail recipes. Built with React and Next.js, it offers a simple yet powerful way to explore a wide range of cocktail options without the need for a fully stocked bar. It uses the [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) API to provide a comprehensive list of cocktails and ingredients. Users can search for cocktails by name, category, glass type, or alcholic content.

## Features

- Search for cocktails by name, category, glass type, or alcoholic content
- View detailed information about each cocktail, including ingredients and instructions
- Dive into individual ingredients to see what other cocktails they are used in
- Save cocktails to a favorites list for easy access
- View a random cocktail for inspiration
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
